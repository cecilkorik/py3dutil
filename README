This is a C module, to install it you must have a working C compiler like 
GCC installed on your system to build it.

To install it, it should be as simple as typing "python setup.py install"
as root. You can then import it from a python program by doing something
like "from py3dutil import vect, obarr"

Documentation is minimal, but should be good enough if you have a basic
knowledge of 3D programming. Better documentation is on my to-do list...
Sorry.
